We need fans, not clients

I like to share
a little episode of personal experience showing very contrary ways in customer treatment
yet somewhat exemplarily to what one can experience as a customer these days. 

Have you ever
switched your telephone and Internet account from one provide to another? I
bet! 

At around the
same time when I had to, my son had some difficulties with a robot from LEGO
called NXT 2.0\. This quite old but still well working device had some issue
with its display.

After these two
little episodes in customer experience, I am an even bigger fan of Lego and
very disappointed from the telecommunications provider. Why? Because of the two
underlying preconceived ideas of how to treat customers. 

I can clearly
say that Lego did not make any money with us owning this robot. It was bought
years ago from somebody else and we inherited it. Nevertheless, I was treated
not only very friendly; they also were well informed every time I called.
Finally and besides taking all my concerns seriously, they also exchange the
broken device for free. And, I now have a personal telephone contact to Lego if
we would ever have any issues with this Robot again. 

My experience
with the telecoms provider was completely different: I had to call several
times and always spoke to somebody else. From the routines I had to follow and answer
the same questions over and over again, it seemed as if the person on the phone
did not know why I was calling nor had any idea what I already discussed with
colleagues. 

I got annoyed, I
got disappointed, I went through nearly all emotional states you can feel if
somebody is not interested in your concern - in terms of customer experience it
was a disaster. It was not an issue with a specific person or employee; it was
an issue with the structure or the processes of how the call centre customers
are handled - One agent said to me: 

_â€žIf
all our clients would ask for this, this would be too expensive for our
company...!"_

This is the
quote that best describes a purely economic relation!

Do I really want
an economic relation, if the price to pay is this kind of treatment? 

And, from the
point of view of the company, is this really the customer experience they want?
These business relations only aiming at short term wins? Creating bargain-hunting
customers with only interested in best price for the product or service and interchangeable
companies, with customers willing to switch the first moment a cheaper offer comes
into reach and not a hint of loyalty? Why is it so difficult for some companies
to give people this little extra and make people more their fans? Is it only
costs? We all know that a cheaper solution often turns out to be more expensive
in the long run. 

I think a
company can decide between having fans or manifest an economically relationship.

Fans are in an
emotional relation with the company 

Fans have the
strong belief that the company understand their situation, whether it can solve
it in the first place or not

Fans buy the
company's service or your product because they know they will enjoy it

Fans want the
best of experiences

Just think of
the difference in price and experience for a good cup of coffee made at home or
enjoyed when you stay out. Simply because of the superior experience: it makes
us feel better, we can and do allow us this little extra!

It is all about
the relationship - like my experience and my impression of Lego and how these were
strengthened and reinforced. I feel to be more than just client or customer of Lego!

Price can be measured
and therefore compared -- experience is individual. 

But
both can be managed!
